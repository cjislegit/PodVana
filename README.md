# PodVana

<p>A fledgling podcast app that aims at taking all the best features from other apps and putting them in one.</p><br>

# But Why?

<p>I love podcasts and have tried many podcast apps and, while they all get the job done, they all seem to have trade-offs. So I decided to build my own and, I am making open source so hopefully, others will add features they love.</p><br>

# Tech

- Vanila Javasciprt
- HTML
- CSS
- Firebase
- Listen API

<br>

# Installation

<p>There are four things you need to do to get the app running. First clone the repo, then head on over to Listen Notes to get a free account and API key, after that go to Firebase and create a new project and set up Cloud Firestore, and finally create a new file in the PODVANA folder called keys.js. In this file create the const listenKey and set it equal to your API key. In that same file paste the firebaseConfig var from Firebase. You can now run the code on a local server. </p>
